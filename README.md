### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<p>
My name is Gabriela Rodriguez, I majored in Business and Translation, but I recently discovered a passion for Software engineering.
In 2022 I did SheCodes Basics and in March, 2023 I entered 42 Porto.
I've learned a lot and will continue to learn in and outside the cluster.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 42's Common Core
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently fluent in C and getting there in C++ & Python
- ğŸ˜„ I love design and animation!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can juggle
