### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
My name is Gabriela Rodriguez and im a software noobeloper (hehe). I'm Venezuelan and i've been in Portugal for 15 years. I majored in Business and Translation, but i recently discovered that what I really want to do is Software engineering.
In 2022 i did SheCodes Basics and in 2023 I entered 42 Porto.
I've learned a lot and will continue to learn in and outside of the cluster.
